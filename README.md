## 📈 Data Analysis 

In 8 months Restaurant earned 7000$ and hosted 500 Customers. From 1 January to 14 August Restaurant accepted 2000 orders. The hottest month for the Company was May. Through all these months there was two Price peaks, in March and July. The same chart reminds classic type of Chart: Double Top. Number of Customers and Quantities was stable, but the highest were from start of the season, in March and lasted until the end of the season, in August. In August every single value went down quickly and the reason may be holidays and people are in other places at that time.
The biggest income in this Restaurant was made by these 3 Products: Pizza, Brownie and Fries. These 3 Products were mostly picked by Customers. The least income in this Restaurant was made by Ice cream, but the next Chart shows that Customers order Ice Cream quite frequently. It suggests that the Price of each Ice Cream should be a little bit higher. One of the reason are parents who visit Restaurants with their kids and they rarely pay attention to the price when child wants a dessert, so little change shouldn't make big difference.

Payment Method:
The most people pay for Food by Cash and secondly by Credit Card. The Cash Method is the most optimal and gave stable income until August. The number on Customers with this Method was relatively stable, but Quantity had peak in May and after this month the graph decreased step by step. The most ordered Foods were Salad, Brownie and Soup. It can suggest that these product could be ordered by older people, because they can be scared of paying by Card and they rarely choose Fast Foods like Hamburger or Pizza.
People who pay with Credit Card make the Price Chart increase. The chart had its lows but it was going up until August where it went straight down. The number of Customers and Quantities went quickly up until April, but after this month the chart was slowly making his lows. The most common Foods were Fries, Pasta and Cakes. These types of Foods are frequently choosen by younger people who are more familiar with credit cards.
